## Project:
The goal of this project was to create a single-page application featuring a neighbourhood map. Using knockoutJS to display a filterable list and using Google Maps API to display map markers of locations, when a marker is clicked it employs the FourSquare API to populate the InfoWindow with details about the site. I made the map of cafes I frequent around the city of Perth, Western Australia.

The application uses Bootstrap4 for responsiveness across desktop, tablets and phone browsers. 

## Running the app:
To view the application in your browser clone or download this repo and extract to a location.
